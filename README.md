## Overview

The R package ggside expands on the ggplot2 package. This package allows
the user to add graphical information about one of the main panelâ€™s
axis. This is particularly useful for metadata for discrete axis, or
summary graphics on a continuous axis such as a boxplot or a density
distribution.

## Installation

Please install from CRAN for the latest stable version of `ggside`. You
can also install from the Github as seen below.

``` r
#CRAN
utils::install.packages("ggside")
#Github
devtools::install_github("jtlandis/ggside")
```

## Usage

Using this package is similar to adding any additional layer to a
ggplot. All geometries supported by ggside follow a pattern like
`geom_xside*` or `geom_yside*` which will add that geometry to either
the x side panel or the y side panel respectively. If you add
`geom_xsidedensity` to a plot, then this places a density geometry in
its own panel that is positioned by default above the main panel. This
panel will share the same x axis of the main panel but will have an
independent y axis. Take the following example from the ggplot2 readme.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggside)
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'ggside':
#>   method from   
#>   +.gg   ggplot2

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_xsidedensity(aes(y = after_stat(density)), position = "stack") +
  geom_ysidedensity(aes(x = after_stat(density)), position = "stack") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = .5))
```

Mix discrete and continuous axis with `scale_xsidey_*`/`scale_ysidex_*`.

``` r
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_xsideboxplot(aes(y =class), orientation = "y") +
  scale_xsidey_discrete() + #In order to use xsideboxplot with a main panel that uses
  #continuous data, force y axis in xside panel to be discrete
  geom_ysidedensity(aes(x = after_stat(density)), position = "stack") +
  scale_ysidex_continuous(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90), minor_breaks = NULL) +
  theme(ggside.panel.scale = .3)
```
