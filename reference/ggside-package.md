# ggside: Side Grammar Graphics

The grammar of graphics as shown in 'ggplot2' has provided an expressive
API for users to build plots. 'ggside' extends 'ggplot2' by allowing
users to add graphical information about one of the main panel's axis
using a familiar 'ggplot2' style API with tidy data. This package is
particularly useful for visualizing metadata on a discrete axis, or
summary graphics on a continuous axis such as a boxplot or a density
distribution.
